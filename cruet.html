				 <h2> olive oil cruet concept + render </h2>
				 <p> <strong> timeline: </strong> 3 weeks </p>

         <h3> overview </h3>
				 <p> This concept was created as the result of a look into the classics of Italian industrial design. The main source of inspiration that drove the concept was the work of Ettore Sottsass - one of the most prominent designers of the 20th century.

       <h3> process </h3>
					<p>
						My team researched and analyzed the values present in Sottsass’s work and the ways they find reflection in final physical form.
          	Two main values that helped guide our process are <strong>attention to material</strong> and <strong>achieving complexity with the least amount of excess volume</strong>. Our product of choice was an olive oil cruet as it is one of the most common objects in traditional Italian households.

					</p>
					<p>
						Though the typology research we collected a wide array of shapes visible in the design of oil containers across cultures and time periods. It inspired us to look beyond modern oil bottles with standardized metal pourers.

					</p>
					<p> By excluding the metal pourer from the final product form we managed to reinforce a historically traditional look of an oil cruet. It helped achieve an elegant form that is both visually unified and functionally easy to use.

         <h3> final form </h3>

				 <p> Sottsass’s philosophy of combining complexity and minimalism found its reflection in the smart recombination present in this cruet. We blended an olive oil cruet and a vase into one object that allows to infuse oil with aromatic herbs. This added dimension of complexity introduced conceptual and functional value to the product without making the form excessive.

	        <h3> reflection </h3>
				<p>
					This project was my first encounter with the field of industrial design. It taught me to approach everyday objects from a different perspective - thinking about their form, position in space and relationship with the environment and other objects around. Apart from that I had a chance to develop my 3D modeling and rendering skills which were applicable to my consequent personal and academic projects.
