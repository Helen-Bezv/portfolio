         <h3> overview </h3>
				 <p> This project showcases the result of my 1-year long commitment as a Graphic Designer for the TEDxSFU 2017 conference.
				 </p>
				 <p> The conference held at Granville Island Stage in November 2017 was sold at 97% capacity, attracting a total of 445 attendees who came out to support 11 diverse speakers sharing their ideas worth spreading.
         </p>
				 <p> During my time in this role, I was responsible for the design of all print and digital media excluding social media imagery. I was reporting the results of my work to the board of directors in weekly meetings. </p>

       <h3> concept </h3>
					<p>
						The first stage of the project was dedicated to the development of the conference’s brand identity. For this task, I collaborated with the visual designer Renee McMillen who was later responsible for the social media imagery.  The overall visual language of the conference remains compliant with TED branding standards, however every year's visual identity is designed to reflect a selected theme.
					</p>
					<p>
						The theme for the 2017 conference was “Shift”. [more process] The concept of movement, change and paradigm shifts found its reflection in the final logo where the “i” is replaced with simplified arrows pointing up and down.
					</p>
					<p> This concept drove the rest of the conference’s identity and proved to be a memorable and easily identifiable mark that could be applied to a variety of digital and physical assets.
					One of the main challenges I faced during this project was adhering to the visual identity without replicating the same design over and over, since the project spanned from February 2017 to March 2018.
